        <h3>Mission Details</h3>
        <p>
            1. Launch Date:
November 16, 1973
2. Mission Duration:
84 days, 1 hour, 15 minutes
Skylab 4 was the longest Skylab mission, lasting nearly three months in space.
3. Launch Vehicle:
Saturn IB
This powerful rocket was used to launch the Apollo Command and Service Modules (CSM) along with the crew into orbit, where they rendezvoused with Skylab.
4. Mission Objectives:
Skylab 4 had a variety of objectives, primarily focused on scientific research and experimentation, including:

Astronomical Observations: Using Skylab's solar telescopes to study the Sun, including solar flares, sunspots, and the Sun's outer atmosphere.
Earth Observation: Taking photographs and collecting data on Earth’s resources, weather patterns, and environmental changes.
Biomedical Experiments: Studying the effects of long-term space travel on the human body, including muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and cardiovascular changes.
Student Experiments: Skylab 4 also carried out experiments proposed by students, such as spider web formation in microgravity.
5. Skylab Space Station:
Skylab was the first U.S. space station, launched in May 1973. It orbited the Earth and served as a laboratory for scientific research in microgravity. It provided living quarters, workspaces, and scientific equipment for astronauts to carry out various experiments.
6. Crew of Skylab 4:
Gerald Carr (Commander)  Led the mission and was responsible for overseeing operations aboard Skylab.
William Pogue (Pilot)  Piloted the Command Module and contributed to scientific experiments.
Edward Gibson (Science Pilot)  A scientist specializing in solar physics, Gibson operated Skylab’s solar observatory and conducted extensive research on the Sun.
7. Scientific Experiments and Discoveries:
Solar Observations: Skylab 4 astronauts used the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) to observe the Sun in different wavelengths, capturing detailed images of solar phenomena such as flares, prominences, and sunspots. This was a major contribution to solar astronomy.
Medical Experiments: One of the key goals of Skylab 4 was to study the physiological effects of long-duration spaceflight. The astronauts underwent daily exercise routines and were monitored for changes in muscle mass, bone density, and cardiovascular function.
Earth Observations: Skylab 4 also contributed to Earth sciences, providing high-resolution images of various geographical features and environmental phenomena, such as hurricanes, deforestation, and urban development.
Space Spiders: One famous experiment involved observing spiders in space, studying how they adapted to microgravity while building webs. The spiders managed to adjust, though their webs were less symmetrical compared to those on Earth.
8. Crew Challenges:
Skylab 4 was notable for some tension between the crew and Mission Control. The crew experienced mental and physical fatigue due to the heavy workload and long duration in space. At one point, they requested a reduction in their workload and more free time. This incident is sometimes referred to as the "Skylab 4 mutiny," though it was more of a breakdown in communication. After taking a break, the crew and Mission Control worked together to adjust the schedule, leading to a more efficient mission.
9. Return to Earth:
The Skylab 4 crew returned to Earth on February 8, 1974, after spending 84 days in space. They splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, and their spacecraft was recovered by the USS New Orleans.
