        <h3>Mission Details</h3>
        <p>
            1. Launch Date:
December 7, 1972
Apollo 17 was the only Apollo mission to launch at night, lifting off from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 12:33 AM EST.
2. Mission Duration:
12 days, 13 hours, 52 minutes
The mission lasted from December 7, 1972, to December 19, 1972.
3. Landing on the Moon:
December 11, 1972
The Lunar Module, Challenger, landed in the Taurus-Littrow valley, chosen for its varied geological features, including highlands and valleys.
4. Astronauts of Apollo 17:
Eugene Cernan (Commander) – The last person to walk on the Moon.
Harrison Schmitt (Lunar Module Pilot) – The first and only professional scientist (a geologist) to walk on the Moon.
Ronald Evans (Command Module Pilot) – Stayed in lunar orbit aboard the Command Module America.
5. Scientific Objectives:
Apollo 17 had a strong focus on scientific exploration, including geology, lunar surface samples, and space phenomena. Some of the mission objectives were:

Surface Exploration: Extensive geological sampling and analysis.
Surveying Lunar Highlands and Valleys: Studying the ancient lunar crust and volcanic features.
Deployment of Scientific Instruments: Instruments to study the lunar atmosphere and surface properties.
Orbital Experiments: Conducted from the Command Module to gather lunar data from orbit.
6. Surface Activities:
Longest Stay on the Lunar Surface: The Apollo 17 crew spent about 75 hours (more than 3 days) on the Moon.
Longest Moonwalks: The crew performed three extravehicular activities (EVAs) or moonwalks, lasting over 22 hours in total.
Distance Traveled: Cernan and Schmitt drove the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) for about 35 kilometers (22 miles) across the lunar surface, the farthest distance traveled in any Apollo mission.
Sample Collection: The astronauts collected 115.4 kg (254 pounds) of lunar samples, including rocks and soil, the most of any Apollo mission.
7. Landing Site: Taurus-Littrow Valley:
The Taurus-Littrow region was chosen for its unique geological diversity, featuring both ancient highlands and relatively young volcanic material. The astronauts studied and sampled this region extensively.
8. Scientific Discoveries:
Orange Soil Discovery: One of the most exciting discoveries was the orange soil, which turned out to be volcanic ash from ancient eruptions, providing evidence of past volcanic activity on the Moon.
Geological Studies: Schmitt, as a professional geologist, was able to apply his expertise in the field, making detailed observations and collecting valuable samples for further study on Earth.
9. Return to Earth:
Apollo 17 successfully returned to Earth on December 19, 1972, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The crew and the Command Module were recovered by the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga.
10. Significance:
Last Human Moon Mission: Apollo 17 was the last time humans set foot on the Moon. No one has returned to the lunar surface since 1972.
Eugene Cernan's Final Words on the Moon: As he prepared to leave the lunar surface, Cernan said, "We leave as we came, and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind."
11. Scientific Instruments Deployed:
The astronauts set up several instruments as part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP):
Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment: To study moonquakes and the structure of the lunar crust.
Lunar Surface Gravimeter: To measure the gravitational forces on the Moon.
Heat Flow Experiment: To measure the heat coming from the Moon's interior.
12. Impact of Apollo 17:
Apollo 17 brought back the most comprehensive scientific data from the Moon. Its geological samples and experiments have provided valuable insights into the Moon’s history and formation.
It demonstrated the importance of sending scientists, like Harrison Schmitt, to explore other worlds.
